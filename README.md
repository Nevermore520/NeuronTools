# ${1:NeuronTools}

This repository contains all tools I used to perform data testing on neuron cells.

## Java/src
The Java/src/ folder contains code to transform original swc files to new files, which has different file format, which can be used to compute Persistent Diagrams by using code in CPP/src/
## CPP/src
The CPP/src folder contains code to compute Persistent Diagrams from those files prepared by code in Java/src/.
## Wasserstein
The wasserstein/ folder contains code to compute Persistent Distance Matrix from Persistent Diagrams computed by code in CPP/src/.

Still under contruction...
