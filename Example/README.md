# Summary
This document contains three manually created neuron trees, as well as their persistent diagrams, vectorized persistent diagrams, and pairwise distances.

## Tree Plot
Below are three manually created neuron trees. They are created in two dimensonal space to have a easier view. The second one and the third one are built based on the first one by adding some extra hairs along edges of the first one. All of them have the same root (5.0, 5.0). The original *.swc files are [here](https://github.com/Nevermore520/NeuronTools/tree/master/Example/neuron%20files).
