# Distance Maxtrix Generator from Vectorized Persistent Diagrams
Given results files generated by code [here](https://github.com/Nevermore520/NeuronTools), this code will generate distance matrix from vectorized Persistent Diagrams.

# usage
Refer to README file in [NeuronTools](https://github.com/Nevermore520/NeuronTools) for details on how to run this code and provide arguments in Eclipse.
The main function is in main.cpp <br/>

It needs at least three arguments. The first one is the path to the folder that contains result files generated by code [here](https://github.com/Nevermore520/NeuronTools/tree/master/Java/src). The second one is the path to a new file that will contain the result distance matrix. And the third one is the vector size. There is an extra optional argument specify the sample range of each Persistent Diagram.<br/>

## Input File format
Check [here](https://github.com/Nevermore520/NeuronTools/blob/master/Java/src/README.md) for the output file format, which is used as input file by this code.

## Output File format
Encoding: ASCII text<br/>
First line contains 2 number specify the size of the distance matrix.
The rest file is an M by M matrix, which is the distance matrix.
