The main function is in NTmain.cpp <br/>

It needs two arguments. The first one is the path to the folder that contains result files generated by code [here](https://github.com/Nevermore520/NeuronTools/tree/master/Java/src). The second one is the path to a new folder that will contain the result persistence diagram files. <br/>

## Input File format
Check [here](https://github.com/Nevermore520/NeuronTools/blob/master/Java/src/README.md) for the output file format, which is used as input file by this code.
